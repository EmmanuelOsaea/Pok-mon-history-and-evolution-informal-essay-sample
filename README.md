**Pokemon Trading Card Game: History and Evolution**

The Pokémon Trading Card Game as we all know has been a widely acceptable phenomenon since its creation by Creatures Inc. in 1996. From its early beginnings with Media Factory in Japan to its worldwide recognition under The Pokémon Company, this iconic game has amassed millions. Initially guided by Wizards of the Coast, the creators of Magic: The Gathering, the Pokémon TCG’s journey is an amazing blend of history, strategy, and enthusiasm.

**The Base: Background and History**

The first TCG expansion set was the "Expansion pack" from the original series. It was released on the 20th of October 1996 in Japan and the 9th of January 1999 in the  US. This expansion set embodies 102 cards in both Japanese and English. Even though the release in the US was in Jan 1999 it took months before it was seen.

This was because most stores refused to sell the new card game. All the first prints were shadowless cards and they were weaker than the 2nd to 7th print run named "unlimited". They also had an 8th print run called "Base 2000". There are also themedecks like a 2-player starter set, blackout, and brushfire to mention a few. Weo has several cards from the base set which are either rare holo, rare, uncommon, or common.
